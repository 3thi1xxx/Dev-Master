2. **FastMemeAnalyzer** ⚠️ - Analysis working, scoring broken
3. **AxiomAPIService** ❌ - 500 errors (expected, fallback should work)
4. **BirdeyeWebSocketManager** ✅ - Enhanced data extraction working
5. **PaperTradingService** ✅ - Ready for trades (no opportunities generated)

### **Enhanced Features**

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE: FALLBACK SCORING**

### **Problem Description**
All tokens are getting `undefined` scores and `AVOID` recommendations, despite:
- Aggressive configuration being active
- Fallback scoring system being implemented
- Token detection and analysis working perfectly

### **Evidence**
```
[LIVE] 📊 Score: undefined/100, Action: AVOID
[LIVE] 💰 Position: 0.01, Confidence: 45%
[LIVE] 📊 Analysis result: SCOOT → AVOID (Score: 0)
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Debug Logging Missing**: Fallback scoring debug messages not appearing
- **Function Call Issue**: `calculateMemeScore` may not be called properly
- **Data Flow Problem**: Token data structure may not match expectations

### **Impact**
- **Trading Opportunities**: 0% (should be 20-30%)
- **Paper Trading**: No positions opened
- **Strategy Validation**: Cannot test aggressive settings

---

## 🔍 **DIAGNOSIS & DEBUGGING**

### **What We Know Works**
1. **Token Detection**: 103 tokens detected successfully
2. **Quick Filter**: Passing tokens with $4260+ liquidity
3. **Analysis Pipeline**: Completing in 200-300ms
4. **System Stability**: No crashes or major errors
5. **Test Script**: `test_aggressive_paper_trading.js` works perfectly

### **What Needs Debugging**
1. **Scoring Function**: Why `calculateMemeScore` isn't working
2. **Data Flow**: How token data reaches scoring function
3. **Fallback Trigger**: Why fallback scoring isn't activating
4. **Debug Logging**: Why debug messages aren't appearing

### **Debugging Commands**
```bash
# Monitor for debug output
tail -f server.log | grep "FAST-MEME"

# Check for fallback triggers
grep "Using fallback scoring" server.log

# Monitor score calculations
grep "Score calculation" server.log
```

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Priority 1: Fix Fallback Scoring (30 minutes)**
1. **Debug Analysis Pipeline**: Trace data flow from detection to scoring
2. **Add More Logging**: Identify where scoring function fails
3. **Test Token Data Structure**: Verify data format matches expectations
4. **Verify Function Calls**: Ensure `calculateMemeScore` is called

### **Priority 2: Validate Strategy (2 hours)**
1. **Monitor Trading Opportunities**: Watch for BUY/STRONG BUY signals
2. **Track Paper Trading**: Monitor position opening and performance
3. **Measure Win Rate**: Track profitability of new trades
4. **Optimize Thresholds**: Fine-tune based on real performance

### **Priority 3: Scale and Optimize (24 hours)**
1. **Increase Token Load**: Test with more concurrent tokens
2. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize analysis speed and accuracy
3. **Risk Management**: Implement stop losses and position sizing
4. **Production Readiness**: Prepare for real trading
