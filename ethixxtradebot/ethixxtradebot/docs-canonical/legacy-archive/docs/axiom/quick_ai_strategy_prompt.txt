You are an expert AI trading strategist. I have a live Solana meme token trading system with these specs:

CURRENT SYSTEM:
- Degen Intelligence Engine (analyzes meme patterns, FOMO, hype)
- Multi-source analysis: Technical + Neural + Birdeye + DexScreener + Cluster7 + Whale + Bubblemaps + GeckoTerminal
- Paper trading: $1000 balance, $200 max positions, aggressive thresholds
- Live cluster7 WebSocket feed for new token launches
- Current problem: Tokens scoring 49-53/100, all "AVOID" recommendations

BIRDEYE PREMIUM PLUS ACCESS:
- Unlimited API calls (vs 50/min free)
- Real-time price feeds (sub-second updates)
- Advanced analytics (holder distribution, LP analysis, security scoring)
- Whale tracking, social sentiment, complete trade history

YOUR TASK:
Analyze and optimize my trading strategy to:
1. Increase token scores from 49-53 to 70-80+
2. Achieve 60%+ win rate on degen trades
3. Maximize Birdeye Premium Plus advantages
4. Identify most profitable meme token patterns
5. Optimize multi-source intelligence weights
6. Design risk management for aggressive trading

KEY QUESTIONS:
- What are the most profitable patterns in meme token trading?
- How to use Birdeye Premium Plus for 1-2 second edge?
- What signal combinations produce highest win rates?
- How to integrate real-time whale tracking?
- What are optimal entry/exit strategies for degen trades?
- How to manage portfolio heat with multiple positions?

Provide specific, actionable recommendations with expected performance improvements and implementation priority order.
