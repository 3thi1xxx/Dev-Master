```bash
# Watch for opportunities
node monitor_fast_meme.js

# Check system stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/stats

# View dashboard
open http://localhost:3000
```

### **3. Key Metrics to Watch**

## üîÑ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Run live testing** for 24-48 hours
2. **Monitor paper trading results**
3. **Fine-tune scoring weights** based on results
4. **Implement SmartExitStrategy.js** for better exits

## üí° **CONCLUSION**

The fast meme trading system is now ready for paper trading. The focus on speed and momentum over comprehensive analysis should significantly improve opportunity detection for short-lived meme coins. Monitor closely and adjust parameters based on live results.

**Remember**: Meme coin trading is high-risk momentum gambling. This system tilts the odds slightly in your favor through speed and whale intelligence, but losses are expected. Trade responsibly!
